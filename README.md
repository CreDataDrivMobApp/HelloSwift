# Hello Swift! 
In this workshop, we will go through some of the basic language features of Swift

1. Imperative Programming 
2. Data Structures and Programming
3. Functional Programming
4. Object-oriented Programming

Swift combines multiple programming paradigms and gives you the flexibility to choose whatever paradigm for your application development.

Once you're comfortable with the above topics go `helloswift/main.swift` to complete the tasks
